# Simple Countdown for Spigot servers 1.14+

There are no permissions to give to this plugin.

## Simpy use the:

  /start <seconds> (for example: /start 120, which will give you a two minute countdown)

## Or:

  /start 2m (which will give you a two minute countdown as well, but you can type´in minutes instead of seconds, unsing the "m" after the   amount)

## or even:

  /start 120s (which is the same like with "m", but in seconds)

## You can stop your countdown by using:

  /stop

## And you can restart the last countdown by using:

  /again

## For any problems or advises, please leave a comment :)
